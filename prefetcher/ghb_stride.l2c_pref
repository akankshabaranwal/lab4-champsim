	Index table
	A table that is indexed by program properties, like Program Counter
	It stores a pointer to a GHB entry
	Size is 256 entries
	Contain a tag for matching, Single pointer into the GHB entry

	Global history buffer
	A circular queue that stores time ordered sequence of the observed cache line addresses. 
	Each GHB entry also stores a pointer called prev_ptr that points to the last cacheline access that has the same IT index.
	By traversing prev_ptr, once can get the temporal sequence of cacheline addresses that points to the same IT entry
	Size is 256 entries

	Stride prefetching algorithm. This logic will go in the l2c_prefetcher_operate part
	For each L2 cache access (both hit and miss) the algorithm uses the PC of the access to:
		1) Index into the IT
		2) Insert the cacheline address into the GHB

	Using PC and link pointers in the GHB entries, the algorithm retrieves the sequence of last 3 addresses by this PC that accessed the L2 cache
	The stride is computed by taking the difference between two consecutive addresses in the sequence.
		1) If two strides match (say d) the prefetcher simply issues prefetch requests to cachelines A + 4d, A+5d, A+6d, A+7d. (correction on piazza)
		This is same as they do in the paper.
